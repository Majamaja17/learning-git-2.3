                    Riders on the storm. 
                    Into this house we're born 
                    Into this world we're thrown 
                    Like a dog without a bone 
                    An actor out on loan
                    Riders on the storm. 
                    There's a killer on the road. 
                    His brain is squirming like a toad. 
                    Take a long holiday 
                    Let your children play. 
                    If you give this man a ride 
                    Sweet memories will die.
